		<p class="first">Dear Friends and bread-lovers</p>
		<p>First of all, thank you so much for your support over the years. As an independent bakery with commitment to
			artisanal methods, we could not have survived the past two years without you.</p>
		<p>With the recent complications due to Brexit, the pandemic and a steep increase in prices have meant that we
			have only just got by. In order to continue to bring you the very best quality, we’ve had to adjust our
			prices. We did not take this decision lightly and hope you understand what a difficult call this was to
			make.</p>
		<p>We’ll still be at our usual spots, waiting to fill your hearts and bellies with the handcrafted labours of
			love.</p>

			<h1>Organic Ingredients</h1>
			<h2>Beautiful Ingredients Sourced from Trusted Suppliers</h2>
			<p>Olivier’s Bakery is proud to use organic and local ingredients from the cold-pressed, extra-virgin 100%
				Italian olive oil down to the unsalted butter, artisanally made from milk sourced from pasture-fed cows
				in Britain. Most of our flour is organic and stone ground in Shipton, a mill in Gloucestershire dating
				back to medieval times. Using organic flours means every batch is different, requiring the baker’s keen
				and observant eye like an orchestra conductor to harmoniously pull every element together. No added
				gluten, no preservatives, no improvers, no rubbish.</p>

		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		<p>‘There is nothing more beautiful than creating honest food and making people happy.’</p>
		<p>Everything we bake embodies our passion for traditional artisan methods, our respect for organic local
			produce and our patience-driven approach to delicious food. Our breads and pastries are hand-crafted, baked
			daily at sunrise and we source our stone-ground flours from local mills. Bread was one of the first foods to
			be shared between early civilisations and that is what we try to teach. We place bread back where it
			belongs—at the centre of the table from which loved ones can rip, pull, tear and above all, share.</p>

			<h1>Traditional Methods</h1>
			<h2>A Long Tradition of French Savoir-Faire</h2>
			<p>Our bakeries, our products and the methods we employ are part of a timeless French savoir-faire,
				sophisticated and homely in equal measure. Our capital’s changing humidity also plays its role in the
				way we bake, as an act as simple as opening the bakery window can lead to a crunchier crust or a denser
				dough. Baking is one of the oldest art forms and we believe it requires few yet essential ingredients:
				flour, water, a dash of sea salt and a great deal of love and patience.</p>
